# Cloud Computing

Cloud computing is the on-demand availability and delivery of computer system (IT) resources over the Internet. It mostly operates with pay-as-you-go pricing model.
Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers, we can access services, such as computing power, storage, and databases, as and when needed from a cloud provider.

The three main cloud providers in the market currently are **"Amazon Web Services"**, **"Microsoft Azure"** and **"Google Cloud"**.
