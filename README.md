# Cloud Computing

Cloud computing is the on-demand availability and delivery of computer system (IT) resources over the Internet. It mostly operates with pay-as-you-go pricing model.
Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers, we can access services, such as computing power, storage, and databases, as and when needed from a cloud provider. It allows companies to lower costs, become more agile and innovate faster.

The three main cloud providers in the market currently are **"Amazon Web Services"**, **"Microsoft Azure"** and **"Google Cloud"**.

## Saas, PaaS and IaaS

### IaaS 

Infrastructure-as-a-service is a service where the cloud provider provides us with the infrastructure service, like storage and virtualisation. Using IaaS gives us the flexibility to purchase only the components we need and scale them up or down as needed. There's no maintenance costs so it is a very affordable option to run the infrastructure on the cloud.

Example: DigitalOcean, AWS, Microsoft Azure

### PaaS

Platform-as-a-service is a service where provider hosts the hardware and software on its own infrastructre and delivers this platform to the user as an integrated solution. It is primarily useful for developers and programmers. It allows the user to develop, run and manage their own apps without having to build and maintain the infrastructure or platform usually associated with the process.

Example: Heroku, Google App Engine, Red Hat OpenShift, Red Hat

### SaaS

Software-as-a-service, also known as cloud application service is the delivery of an entire application that is managed by a provider, via a web browser. There is no installation of the software on individual machines required.

- Example: Outlook, Gmail, Facebook, Dropbox, github
