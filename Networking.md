## Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)

Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) enables you to launch AWS resources into a virtual network that you've defined. This virtual network closely resembles a traditional network that you'
d operate in your own data center, with the benefits of using the scalable infrastructure of AWS.

## Internet Gateway (IG)

An internet gateway is a horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC component that allows communication between your VPC and the internet. It supports IPv4 and IPv6 traffic. It does not cause availability risks or bandwidth constraints on your network traffic.

## Route Table

A route table contains a set of rules, called routes, that determine where network traffic from your subnet or gateway is directed.
