# Monitoring And Alert Management

## CloudWatch

- Used to Observe and monitor AWS resources and applications.
- Enables us to set alarms and automate actions based on predefined thresholds.
- We can also use machine learning algorithms to detect any different behavior in our metrics.
- We can easily start Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling automatically or stop an instance.

### Resources Monitored by CloudWatch 

- **Amazon EC2**: View metrics for CPU utilization, data transfer, and disk usage activity from Amazon EC2 instances (Basic Monitoring) for no additional charge. For an additional charge, CloudWatch provides Detailed Monitoring for EC2 instances with higher resolution and metric aggregation.
- **Other AWS Resources**: We can monitor services on **Amazon DynamoDB tables**, **Amazon EBS volumes**, **Amazon RDS DB instances**, **Elastic Load Balancers**, **Amazon SQS queues**, **Amazon SNS topics**.
- **Custom Metrics** - We can also monitor Custom Metrics generated by your own applications via a simple API request and have them monitored by Amazon CloudWatch.
Monitor and Store Logs.

### Use-Case of Cloud Watch

- **Monitor Application Performance** - We can visualize performance data, create alarms, and correlate data.
- **Perform root cause Analysis** - We can analyse metrics, logs, logs analytics and user requests for debugging.
- **Optimize resources proactively** - We can automate resource planning and lower costs by setting actions to occur when thresholds are met based on our specifications.
- **Test Website Impacts** - We can figure out when our website is impacted by any of the metrics and for how long by viewing screenshots, logs and web requests.

## SNS (Simple Notification Service)

Amazon Simple Notification Service is a notification service provided as part of Amazon Web Services. It provides a low-cost infrastructure for mass delivery of messages.

- It is a web service which makes it easy to set up, operate, and send a notification from the cloud.
- It is predominently for mobile devices.
- It also sends the notifications through SMS or email to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS), or to an HTTP endpoint.

**Note:** To prevent the loss of data, all messages published to SNS are stored redundantly across multiple availability zones.
