Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is an object storage service. Advantages include:
- **Economical** - S3 is based on a pay-as-you-go model. This allows us to pay only for the amount of storage and the time that we use it.
- **Highly Scalable** - S3 allows us to increase or decrease resource as per our need. It allows for auto-scaling as well for both increase or decrease in demand.
- **Durability** - S3 prevents the likelihood of data loss. The S3 Standard Tier is designed for “99.999999999% durability”.
- **High Availability** - It is readily available in every region.
- **Highly Secure** - It enables automatic encryption of data as soon as the uploading processes is finished.
- **Easy to Manage** - We can easily manage the S3 buckets using any of the methods:
  - **GUI (Graphical User Interface)**: AWS Management Console, web applications, and mobile applications, where each task can be executed with a single click or a tap.
  - **CLI (Command Line Interface)**: AWS provides the command line program package to execute our tasks by running the commands directly.
  - **API (Application Program Interface)**: AWS provides APIs which allow firms to integrate the platform with other technologies in use quickly.

## Use Cases

The most common use cases for S3:

- Backup File System
- Host Static Website
- Create Private Local Repository
- Improve File Sharing

- We need Python3 and pip3 as a pre-requisite for AWS CLI (Command Line Interface). We also need to change the default version to Python3.

Inside the `EC2 Instance`
```
sudo apt-get install python3
sudo apt install python3-pip
alias python=python3
```

- Install AWS CLI
```
pip3 install awscli
```
- Configure AWS CLI
**MAKE SURE YOU DO NOT SHARE YOUR `ACCESS KEY` AND `SECRET KEY` WITH ANYONE.

The previous value is shown within the `[ ]`. If none available it will show `[None]`
```
$ aws configure

AWS Access Key ID [None]: QWERTYUIOPASDFGJKL
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: 3li34asdf8342liverpoollkjasdfalkj123asdfadAwww
Default region name [None]: eu-west-1
Default output format [None]: json

// To View the existing config of modify it.

$ aws configure

AWS Access Key ID [***************GJKL]:
AWS Secret Access Key [********************Awww]:
Default region name [eu-west-1]:
Default output format [json]:

// If any change is needed, provide it, else leave it blank.
```
- Test if we are connected. It will list all the available bucket
```
aws s3 ls
```

## S3 Commands

- To create a bucket

```
$ aws s3 mb s3://<name of bucket>

Example:
$ aws s3 mb s3://eng130-abhishekjha

// If Successful, this message will be displayed

make_bucket: eng130-abhishekjha
```

- To upload a file to the bucket

```
$ aws s3 cp <filename> s3://<name of bucket>

Example:
$ aws s3 cp test-s3.txt s3://eng130-abhishekjha

// If Successful, this message will be displayed
upload: ./test-s3.txt to s3://eng130-abhishekjha/test-s3.txt
```

- Changing Permission - The file we upload to a bucket, by default, will not have read permission. We have to manually specify which permission we want to give.

- To delete a file from bucket

```
$ aws s3 rm s3://<location of file>

Example:
$ aws s3 rm s3://eng130-abhishekjha/test-s3.txt

// If Successful, this message will be displayed
delete: s3://eng130-abhishekjha/test-s3.txt
```

- To delete the bucket

*Note*: Make sure the bucket is empty before deleting it.

```
aws s3 rb s3://<name of bucket>

Example:
$ aws s3 rb s3://eng130-abhishekjha

// If Successful, this message will be displayed
remove_bucket: eng130-abhishekjha
```

*Note*: We can also force delete a bucket, if we are unable to do it normally, using `--force` option at the end.
