Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is an object storage service. Advantages include:
- **Economical** - S3 is based on a pay-as-you-go model. This allows us to pay only for the amount of storage and the time that we use it.
- **Highly Scalable** - S3 allows us to increase or decrease resource as per our need. It allows for auto-scaling as well for both increase or decrease in demand.
- **Durability** - S3 prevents the likelihood of data loss. The S3 Standard Tier is designed for “99.999999999% durability”.
- **High Availability** - It is readily available in every region.
- **Highly Secure** - It enables automatic encryption of data as soon as the uploading processes is finished.
- **Easy to Manage** - We can easily manage the S3 buckets using any of the methods:
  - GUI (Graphical User Interface): AWS Management Console, web applications, and mobile applications, where each task can be executed with a single click or a tap.
  - CLI (Command Line Interface): AWS provides the command line program package to execute our tasks by running the commands directly.
  - API (Application Program Interface): AWS provides APIs which allow firms to integrate the platform with other technologies in use quickly.

## Use Cases

- Backup File System
- Host Static Website
- Create Private Local Repository

- We need Python3 and pip3 as a pre-requisite for AWS CLI (Command Line Interface).
- In the `EC2 Instance` install Python3: `sudo apt-get install python3`
- If the default version of Python is Python2, we can change that: `alias python=python3`
- To install PIP3 - `sudo apt install python3-pip`
- Install AWS CLI
```
sudo pip3 install awscli
```
- Configure AWS CLI
**MAKE SURE YOU DO NOT SHARE YOUR `ACCESS KEY` AND `SECRET KEY` WITH ANYONE.

The previous value is shown within the `[ ]`. If none available it will show `[None]`
```
$ aws configure

AWS Access Key ID [None]: `QWERTYUIOPASDFGJKL`
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: `3li34asdf8342liverpoollkjasdfalkj123asdfadAwww`
Default region name [None]: `eu-west-1`
Default output format [None]: `json`
```
- Test if we are connected.
```
aws s3 ls
```
